STACK DATA STRUCTURE

The stack is implemented using a list.The number of elements which can be pushed into the stack is limited by declaring a size for the list.

The subprocess module is used instead of the os module due to its efficiency in collaborating with the system eg collaboration between IDE's and the windows OS

The program shows implementation of stack functions like push(),pop(),peek(),display() and count().
